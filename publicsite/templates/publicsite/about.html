	<h1>About Infringement</h1>
    <p>2021 is the 17th iteration of Infringement in Buffalo.</p>
    <p>The Buffalo Infringement Festival is a non-profit-driven, non-hierarchical grassroots endeavor bringing together a broad range of eclectic, independent, experimental, and controversial art of all forms. Visual, performing, and media arts are all welcome here.</p>
	<p>Taking place in multiple venues in and around Buffalo’s Allentown District, the festival is an annual eleven-day event running from the last weekend of July through the first weekend of August. See the Infringement Festival International's mandate and our 2006 Mission Statement to learn more. [link TBA]</p>

	<h1>Mandate</h1>
    <p>The Infringement Festival is an interdisciplinary festival open to all critical artists. Celebrating freedom of expression and designed as a real arts democracy, this festival is a critical response to the oppressive neoliberal worldview and all its billboard trucks, televisions, flyers, advertisements, jingles, made-for-TV wars; and the depoliticisation of people through this diversionary Spectacle.</p>

	<p>The Infringement Festival welcomes a variety of performances and cultural resistance: theatre groups, performers, street activism, political theatre, musicians, radical performance, visual artists, films, marginalized arts, spoken-word, puppet shows, disadvantaged groups, and anyone wishing to artistically infringe on the monoculture that creeps into every corner of our lives.</p>

	<p>The Infringement Festival aims to emphasize both critical practice in the arts, and artistic practice in activism. It also aims to provide a positive environment that encourages and nurtures critical art.</p>

	<p>To avoid being co-opted, the Infringement Festival follows a mandate:
	<ul>
	<li>The festival is free for all artists and activists to participate in. The festival will never charge a registration fee and participants will keep 100% of their box office less appropriate technical fees, where applicable.</li>
    <li>The festival is open to all critical artists and will never discriminate, set entry criteria, or censor.</li>
    <li>The festival is run as a non-hierarchical arts democracy.</li>
    <li>The festival will only accept ethical companies that pose no conflict of interest as sponsors, as the interests of the festival’s participants come before those of the sponsors.</li>
    <li>The festival will encourage, although not be limited to, progressive acts that encourage discussion and oppose oppressive structures.</li></ul></p>
